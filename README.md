### Goal:
Prioritize hypotheses, launch an A/B test, and analyze the results.

### Data description:
- hypotheses description and evaluation dataframe.
- orders with date, order id ,user id, group and amount spent.
- visitors with date, group and number of visitors.

### Steps performed:
- Prioritize hypotheses using RICE/ICE frameworks.
- Calculate cumulative revenue by group.
- Calculate cumulative average order size by group and relative difference in cumulative average order size.
- Calculate each group's conversion rate.
- Filter the data from outliers.

### Results:
- I will recomend to stop the test, consider group B the leader due to better conversion rates.
